										<h3>Data Description</h3>
										<p>The data was provided by a Bocconi course, <a href"https://didattica.unibocconi.eu/ts/tsn_anteprima.php?cod_ins=30587&anno=2022&IdPag=">Data-Driven Analysis and Decision-Making in Business</a>.
										It reports information about 11736 startups founded between 1995 and 2014 in the U.S., U.K., Italy, and Israel. There are 44 columns of data from each startup from the following categories: </p>

										<h3>Research Question</h3>
										<p>We set out a research question that oriented our analyses:
											<ul>
												<li> What are the main founding team characteristics that VCs look at when it comes to financing startups?</li>
											</ul>

										<h3>Hypotheses</h3>
										<p>The most promising firms – those of which the founding team has previous quality experience at another startup, successful firm, or has worked in the same industry – will have a higher probability of receiving financing from VCs. 
											Here are the two theories to be tested: 
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Startups whose founders already had a successful business in the past and/or in the same industry are more likely to develop into promising firms.</li>
											<li>Startups whose founders graduated from top universities and have management experience are more likely to develop into promising firms.</li>
										</ol>
										The following analyses uses standardized "founding_rounds" as the dependent/outcome variable and only focus on startups that are still operating.</p>

										<h3>Highlights of Relevant Findings by Theory</h3>
											<h4>Theory I</h4>
												<p>Both of the independent variables used (number of founders in a team who have another experience from a successful startup; 
													number of founders in a team with another experience from the same industry as the startup they now founded) were statistically 
													significant positive correlation with the number of funding rounds received by the startup. Thus, a firm is more likely to receive funding 
													if the founders on the team have both/either experience from a successful startup or experience in the same industry as the startup they now founded.

											<h4>Theory II</h4>
												<p>Out of the three independent variables used (number of founders with experience in Big 5 tech companies; number of top university degrees
													 in the founding team; number of founders with experience from leading consulting firms), only "f_top_uni_degrees" is a statistically 
													 significant positively correlated predictor of number of founding rounds. Not only were Big 5 and MBB experiences not statistically significant, 
													 they also have negative coefficients. This is counterintuitive because, logically, these ex-Big-Tech and ex-MBB consultant would be able to 
													 bring expertise and network from their previous role to increase the chances of procuring funding. Perhaps, due to their former career, they might 
													 have developed a structured way of thinking that works for big firms but hinders creativity, which is critical to the success of startups.

											<h3>Desirable Startup Characteristics</h3>
											<p>Startups have a higher chance of becoming “unicorns” if they were led by one founder CEO, had profits, used a platform business model, and receiving fundings from VCs.</p>
